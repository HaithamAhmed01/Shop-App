# Shop App

A new Flutter application.

## Getting Started ...

flutter e-Commerce application using Bloc, Dio, and shared preferences.

Onboarding screens with skip button. Login and register screens with form validation and shared preferences to save userâ€™s token to see if he/she logged before so the app navigates directly to the home screen. Beautiful home screen with the search bar. The bottom navigation bar moves fast between screens. 4 screens one for products and one for favorites and one for categories. And finally, the settings screen so you can change your data or sign out.
